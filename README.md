Hey, I'm Geovanny ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Backend Developer from La Paz (Robles)/Colombia and working as a Developer BackEnd.

In my spare time I like to code in the Java language. I'm interested in both backend and frontend having practiced them extensively.

From APIs to backend, through cloud and databases, preferrably using a functional programming language.

I wrote "Building Modern Web Applications With Jakarta EE, NoSQL Databases and Microservices" (bpbonline, 2020)".

Beside coding, I'm passionate about football, travels, movies, music and read technology book.

Regards!
